# üß† Memory Match Game  
A feature-rich memory matching card game built with C++ and Raylib, designed to challenge players concentration with multiple difficulty levels. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, custom data structures, and clean game state management.

## üéØ Overview
Memory Match Game challenges players to find matching pairs of cards across three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). Built with Raylib, it demonstrates object-oriented programming principles through custom implementations of strings (`MyStr`) and dynamic arrays (`MyVector`). The game tracks player moves and provides visual feedback for an engaging experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
- **OOP Principles**:  
  - Inheritance via `GameLevel` base class  
  - Encapsulation in card/board logic  
- **Memory Management**:  
  - RAII for texture handling  
  - Manual memory management in `MyVector`  
- **Raylib Integration**:  
  - Texture-based rendering  
  - Collision detection for card clicks
